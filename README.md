A file explorer with a “hacker design” is basically a normal file manager (to browse, open, copy, delete files), but styled to look like those “hacker UIs” you see in movies. That means: dark background, neon green or red text, terminal-like windows, maybe glitch animations or matrix-style effects. Functionally it’s the same as a regular explorer – the “hacker vibe” comes only from the design and visuals.
